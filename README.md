Technical Report
You can imagine your technical report as a primer or recipe on how to replicate your modeling process. Length and format are up to you. At a minimum, your technical report should contain:

How you acquired your data (including any sampling that you did)
How the data should be transformed, including justifying your choices
How you operationalized your outcome variable, including your justification
Your choice of model and any hyperparameters, including what metric or metrics you use to determine a successful model
Any future deployment strategies, additions of data, or modeling techniques you have yet to try
In other words, another Data Scientist should be able to take your techncial report and, without seeing your code, come up with a similar model.

Code
Your code may be structured in any way you choose (though obviously, efficient and well-written code is preferred!) At this point in the process you should have your models finalized for the most part, this is to confirm your code is at a good point.
